## General Info
This project is a production of API with reviews of Truspilot to know if the reviews of customers is postive or negative.
To make this french sentiment analysis we use the pre-trained model camemBERT.

## Installation 

All packages you need is on requirements.txt.
To use just the API use requirements_api.txt

## How to use

* http://127.0.0.1:8000/category - to see the list of categories
